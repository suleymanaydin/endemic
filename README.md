" Aromatic and endemic plants of Turkey: A short list "
<p> This list is about endemic species of the flora of Turkey and east Aegean islands, specially about the <i>aromatic</i> species.
<br> [ naturally some of the families, but not all of the Flora, but possibly _all_ of the aromatic ones ]
<br> This is an old document, almost forgotten for many years (and even it was lost!). 
<br> But for a reason, it was remembered and re_discovered and only two families were recently updated [ shown as double asterisk ( ** ) inside the document ][ My thanks goes to the GNU/Linux  community ] 
<br> This is a simple list, typed by myself.
<br> Hope it will be useful for the community and hope it will be updated in the future.
<br> No work, neither living things are complete or finished.
  
<p> This list is not published anywhere (is there any need?), but if any journal wishes to publish it, small modification(s) is/are still required, this raw format is not suitable for a publication.
  
<p> For any question(s) or suggestion(s), or addition(s) for the list (endemic.htm) are welcome.
  
<p> And of course, due to the <i> ethical code of scientific behaviour,</i>  any one using this list for a publication is expected to <b>cite</b> this document:
