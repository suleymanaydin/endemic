# endemic
Endemic species of the flora of Turkey and east Aegean islands.
[ some of the families, but not all of them ]
This is an old document, almost forgotten for some years.
But for a reason, it was re_discovered and only two families were recently updated [ typed inside the document ] 
This is a simple list, typed by myself (a non-botanist).
Hope it will be useful for someone and hope it will be updated in the future.
No work, neither living things are complete or finished.
For any question(s) or suggestion(s), or addition(s) for the list (endemic.htm) are welcome
And of course, due to the ethical code of scientific behaviour, any one using this list for a publication is expected to cite this document:
