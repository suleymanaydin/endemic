" Aromatic and endemic plants of Turkey: A short list "
<p> This list is ablut endemic species of the flora of Turkey and east Aegean islands.
<br> [ some of the families, but not all of them ]
<br> This is an old document, almost forgotten for some years.
<br> But for a reason, it was re_discovered and only two families were recently updated [ typed inside the document ] 
<br> This is a simple list, typed by myself (a non-botanist).
<br> Hope it will be useful for someone and hope it will be updated in the future.
<br> No work, neither living things are complete or finished.
<br> For any question(s) or suggestion(s), or addition(s) for the list (endemic.htm) are welcome.
  <br> And of course, due to the <i> ethical code of scientific behaviour,</i>  any one using this list for a publication is expected to <b>cite</b> this document:
